# Monster Slayer Adventure
Welcome to the capstone game of my grade 12 year!
Over the course of 2 months, I worked with a group of 3 to complete this fun platformer game in Unity.
It utilizes C# and free assets on the unity store and features several elements like: 
- Platforming, camera movement, attacking and blocking
- Moving enemies and treasure chests
- Inventory system and consumables
- Shop system and gambling system
- Boss fights
- Cutscenes and intuitive user interfaces

I worked on creating the inventory system and consumables, as well as coins, highscores, and user interfaces.

Overall, this was a great project to introduce me to Unity and game design.
